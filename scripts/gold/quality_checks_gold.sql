Quality Checks
=======================================================================
Script Purpose:
This script performs quality checks to validate the integrity, consistency, and accuracy of the Gold layer.
These checks ensure:
- Uniqueness of surrogate keys in dimension tables.
- Referential integrity between fact and dimension tables
- Validation of relationships in the data model for analytical purpose.

Usage notes:
- Run these checks after data loading Silver Layer
- Investigate and resolve any discrepancies found during the checks.

-- Check for uniqueness of Product key in gold.dim_products
